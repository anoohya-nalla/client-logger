- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.  %s%s https://react.dev/link/hydration-mismatch     ...     <div className="MuiBox-roo...">       <Typography>       <Grid>       ...         <div className="MuiGrid-ro...">           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} ref={function ref}>               <Surface cx="50%" cy="50%" width={300} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} ...>                 <svg cx="50%" cy="50%" className="recharts-s..." width={300} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} ...>                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts2-clip" -                     id="recharts45-clip"                     >                   ...               ...           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} onMouseEnter={function} onDoubleClick={function} ...>               <Surface width={500} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} style={{width:"100%", ...}}>                 <svg className="recharts-s..." width={500} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} viewBox="0 0 500 300">                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts6-clip" -                     id="recharts47-clip"                     >                   ...               ...       ...         <div className="MuiGrid-ro...">           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} onMouseEnter={function} onDoubleClick={function} ...>               <Surface width={500} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} style={{width:"100%", ...}}>                 <svg className="recharts-s..." width={500} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} viewBox="0 0 500 300">                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts12-clip" -                     id="recharts50-clip"                     >                   ...               ...           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} onMouseEnter={function} onDoubleClick={function} ...>               <Surface width={500} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} style={{width:"100%", ...}}>                 <svg className="recharts-s..." width={500} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} viewBox="0 0 500 300">                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts18-clip" -                     id="recharts53-clip"                     >                   ...                     <CartesianAxis allowDuplicatedCategory={true} allowDecimals={false} hide={false} orientation="left" ...>                       <_c className="recharts-c..." ref={function ref}>                         <g className="recharts-l..." ref={function ref}>                           <line>                           <g className="recharts-c...">                             <_c>                             <_c>                             <_c>                             <_c>                             <_c className="recharts-c...">                               <g className="recharts-l..." ref={null}>                                 <line>                                 <Text textAnchor="end" verticalAnchor="middle" orientation="left" width={60} height={260} ...>                                   <text                                     orientation="left"                                     width={60}                                     height={260}                                     stroke="none"                                     x={57} +                                   y={12} -                                   y="5"                                     className="recharts-text recharts-cartesian-axis-tick-value"                                     textAnchor="end"                                     fill="#666"                                   >               ...       ...

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.  %s%s https://react.dev/link/hydration-mismatch     ...     <div className="MuiBox-roo...">       <Typography>       <Grid>       ...         <div className="MuiGrid-ro...">           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} ref={function ref}>               <Surface cx="50%" cy="50%" width={300} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} ...>                 <svg cx="50%" cy="50%" className="recharts-s..." width={300} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} ...>                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts2-clip" -                     id="recharts1-clip"                     >                   ...               ...           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} onMouseEnter={function} onDoubleClick={function} ...>               <Surface width={500} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} style={{width:"100%", ...}}>                 <svg className="recharts-s..." width={500} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} viewBox="0 0 500 300">                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts6-clip" -                     id="recharts3-clip"                     >                   ...               ...       ...         <div className="MuiGrid-ro...">           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} onMouseEnter={function} onDoubleClick={function} ...>               <Surface width={500} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} style={{width:"100%", ...}}>                 <svg className="recharts-s..." width={500} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} viewBox="0 0 500 300">                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts12-clip" -                     id="recharts6-clip"                     >                   ...               ...           ...             <div className="recharts-w..." style={{position:"...", ...}} onMouseEnter={function} onDoubleClick={function} ...>               <Surface width={500} height={300} title={undefined} desc={undefined} style={{width:"100%", ...}}>                 <svg className="recharts-s..." width={500} height={300} style={{width:"100%", ...}} viewBox="0 0 500 300">                   <title>                   <desc>                   <defs>                     <clipPath +                     id="recharts18-clip" -                     id="recharts9-clip"                     >                   ...                     <CartesianAxis allowDuplicatedCategory={true} allowDecimals={false} hide={false} orientation="left" ...>                       <_c className="recharts-c..." ref={function ref}>                         <g className="recharts-l..." ref={function ref}>                           <line>                           <g className="recharts-c...">                             <_c>                             <_c>                             <_c>                             <_c>                             <_c className="recharts-c...">                               <g className="recharts-l..." ref={null}>                                 <line>                                 <Text textAnchor="end" verticalAnchor="middle" orientation="left" width={60} height={260} ...>                                   <text                                     orientation="left"                                     width={60}                                     height={260}                                     stroke="none"                                     x={57} +                                   y={12} -                                   y="5"                                     className="recharts-text recharts-cartesian-axis-tick-value"                                     textAnchor="end"                                     fill="#666"                                   >               ...       ...

You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.

This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:  - A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`. - Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called. - Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server. - External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML. - Invalid HTML tag nesting.
